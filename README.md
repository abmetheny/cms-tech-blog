## Site Functionality
* All pages include nav bar with links to the home page, dashboard page, and login/signup page
  * If the visitor is already signed in, the nav bar will instead have a logout link option
  * If the visitor is not signed in, the dashboard page redirects to the login page
  * Clicking on either the logo or the Home link will return the user to the home page
* After signing up or logging in, user credentials are saved; the user is automatically logged out after a set amount of time
* The home page displays all existing blog posts, including the post creator's username and the date the post was created
  * Clicking on a post title opens a new page that only displays that single post
  * On the single post page, a logged in user is able to leave a comment on the post
  * Comments include the comment creator's name and the date the comment was created
* The dashboard page displays all posts created by the signed-in user
  * Clicking the New Post button allows the user to create a new post, which will appear on both the dashboard and the home page once created
